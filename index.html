               <p>
                 Frequent users of food delivery services, like Grubhub, encounter the problem of inaccurate delivery time estimates, which can lead to frustration and inconvenience. These inaccurate wait times can disrupt their meal planning, cause delays in their schedules, and affect their overall dining experience. There is a need for a solution that provides reliable and real time delivery time estimates to enhance the convenience and satisfaction of ordering food online.
